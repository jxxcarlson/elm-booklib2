[Wikipedia artlce on Toucans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keel-billed_toucan)



## Distribution and Habitat

The keel-billed toucan can be found from Southern
Mexico to Venezuela and Colombia. It roosts in
the canopies of tropical, subtropical, and
lowland rain forests, up to altitudes of
1,900 m (6,200 ft). It roosts in holes in
trees, often with several other toucans.
This can be very cramped, so the birds tuck their tails
and beaks under their bodies to conserve space while
sleeping. Adding to the lack of space, the
bottoms of the holes are often covered with pits
from the fruit the toucans have eaten.

**Conservation status:** Least Concern (*Population decreasing*)


## Habitat loss

The threats leading to population declines in birds are
many and varied:

- agriculture
- logging
- invasive species

are the most severe.
